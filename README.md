## Technical Specs
|  | Target | Tested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Java SDK Version | Java 8 Update 231 | Java 8 Update 261 |
| IDE | IntelliJ | IntelliJ |
| DB Management System | MariaDB | MySQL 5.7.28 |
| DB Administration Tool | HeidiSQL | MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE with WAMP 3.2 |

Note: Scripts (e.g. NPC scripts) are written in JavaScript.

This source inherits many Odin-like traits.
This source uses a mixture of architectures; for instance, layered architecture where scripts, business logic, and data are kept distinct. Note also, within the business logic, the use of MVC-like concepts.


**Instructions for use:**
1. `Clone` or `Fork` this repository
2. Setup the DB management system (i.e. MariaDB or MySQL Workbench)
    - By default the username may be set to `root` and the password left empty, with SSL disabled. Port should be set to `3306`.
3. Setup the DB administrion tool (i.e. HeidiSQL or MySQL Workbench)
    - Run either one of the SQL script files found in `AzureV316/sql/`
    - It should create a new schema named `kms_316`.
    - Note that this will cause errors if MySQL Workbench is running in safe mode. Follow the error message instructions to disable safe mode.
4. Turn **off** innodb strict mode.
    - This can be achieved by editing the `.ini` file in the install path of the DB management system, and requires a restart
5. Open the project in IntelliJ (or your IDE of choice), and allow the IDE to finish indexing (if applicable).
6. Configure project settings. (IntelliJ: File -> Project structure)
    - Set the project SDK to an appropriate JDK version (see above in tech specs)
    - Ensure that all the required libraries (in `AzureV316/AzureMS/lib/`) are imported.
7. Ensure that the details in **Step 2** are reflected in the source code.
    1. Hit `Shift` twice to bring up the search menu.
    2. Select the first option.
    3. Check the username and password strings in `MYSQL.java` are correct.
8. Navigate to `Azure_316\AzureV316\AzureMS\src\launcher` to reach `Start.java`.
    - Try `Build` and `Run` this file. (HeidiSQL or WAMP should be running in background)
    - Note that the first build/run may take quite a while!
